1. Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.

.forEach does not return a new array, but .map returns a new array. Also, .map returns a new array of elements while in turn passing each element back to the callback.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

A function is defined outside of an object. A method is defined as the property of an object.

3. What is closure?

It's the combination of a function enclosed with references to its surrounding state (lexical environment). It gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

  A. Window/Global Object Binding = When in the global scope, the value of "this" will be the Object that lies in the window/console.
  B. Implicit Binding = The value of "this" is the Object that is to the left of the dot whenever a preceding dot calls a function.
  C. New Binding = Whenever we create an object with a constructor function, the value of "this" is the new object that has been created and returned.
  D. Explicit Binding = The value of "this" is explicitly defined whenever we use the call or apply method.


5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

We need it because it's used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
